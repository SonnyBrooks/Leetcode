# SPOILER ALERT
These are LeetCode solutions. Of course, you can use them for reference, but please know that not all solutions are optimal. If you're new to the game, I encourage you to take this message as a sign to give it 5 more minutes of own will power to try to figure it out on your own before you reference these solutions. 

Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions.

## Design
In the design directory, I've taken some prompts and described how I might build a solution. If you'd like to add to the discussion or challenge my design choices, please leave a comment! I'd love to discuss!
